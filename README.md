# Stock Market Predictor Platform

The **Stock Market Predictor Platform** is a comprehensive, modular, and extensible platform for analyzing, visualizing, and predicting stock market trends using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. The repository blends data science workflows (Jupyter Notebooks), robust backend logic (Python), and modern frontend technologies (TypeScript/JavaScript) to provide an end-to-end solution for financial data analysis and prediction.

## Features

- 📈 **Data Collection & Processing:** Automated scripts and notebooks for fetching, cleaning, and processing financial data from various sources.
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizations and summary statistics to uncover trends and anomalies in stock market data.
- 🤖 **Predictive Modeling:** Implementation of classic ML algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forests) and deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, GRU) for price prediction.
- 🧪 **Backtesting & Evaluation:** Tools to test prediction strategies against historical data and evaluate model performance.
- 🖥️ **User-friendly Interface:** Modern web frontend for visualizing predictions, analytics, and interacting with the platform.
- 🔌 **Extensibility:** Modular architecture making it easy to integrate new models, data sources, and visualization tools.

## Tech Stack

- **Jupyter Notebook:** For data exploration, prototyping, and sharing analyses.
- **Python:** Core predictive algorithms, data handling, and backend logic.
- **TypeScript/JavaScript:** Frontend application, interactive dashboards, and API communication.
- **Other:** Various utilities and configuration files.
